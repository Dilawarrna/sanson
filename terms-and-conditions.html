                  <li>Entries must be received by the Promoter during the Promotion Period. Online or email entries are deemed to have been received at the time of receipt by the Promoter and not at the time of transmission. </li>
                  <li>The use of automated entry software or other mechanical, electronic or other means that allow an Entrant to automatically enter the Promotion repeatedly is prohibited and will render all entries submitted by the Entrant invalid.</li>
                  <li>Incomplete and ineligible entries will be deemed invalid. Entries will also be deemed invalid if they breach these Terms & Conditions as determined by the Promoter in its sole discretion or any other content guidelines notified by the Promoter during completion of the Entrant’s completion of the Entry Procedure. </li>
                  <li>The Promoter reserves the right, at any time, to verify the validity of entries and Entrants (including an Entrant’s identity, age and place of residence) and to disqualify any Entrant. Failure by the Promoter to enforce any of its rights at any stage does not constitute a waiver of those rights.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Prize Draw</h5>
                <ol>

                  <li>As the Promotion is a game of chance, and subject otherwise to these Terms & Conditions, skill plays no part in determining the Winner and each valid entry will NOT be individually judged.

The Promoter’s decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into with Entrants regarding the decision. </li>
                  <li>In the event that a Winner’s entry is deemed or found to be invalid, the Promoter may redraw or decide on another winning entry.</li>
